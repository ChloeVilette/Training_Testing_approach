  ### Assessment of the ranking methods' reliability using a training-testing approach.


## Two codes are offered here. 
- Ranking.methods.Rmd allows anyone to reproduce the study. All the excel files are needed to run the code
- snapshot.code.Rmd seeks to show more easily the split between training and testing datasets and how it is applied to the 2 studied types of approach: dynamic and static. Here only "dominance.data" file is needed to run the code.
